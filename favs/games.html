        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I do not play much games. I only play for some dopamine shots every now and then. I prefer games that focus on fast reacting and does not require much &quot;thorough&quot; thinking; I play to have fun after all!</p>
        <p>I love playing board/ web games frequently, they are fun af with friends!</p>
        <p>I will include three games I prefer/ play a lot, three funny &quot;board&quot; games, then the games I played and I think they are playable.</p>
         <br/><h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
        <p>I suck playing the game, but tbh it is my fav game ever. It's natively available for linux on Steam, and I like valve. I usually play it for maximum of 3 hours per week. I stop playing it for a year each now and then, but I am usually back~! Hackers/ Smurfers suck though, and make the game shitty sometimes.</p>
         <br/><h2>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
        <p>This is like the moder version of CSGO for me. I like it but it requires me using VFIO/ Dual Boot so I don't play it that much. However, if they considered being native to Linux/ EAC and BattleEye stopped their shit with Linux, it will be my all-time game. It involves less hackers than CSGO. My only comment is their fucking high-sized updates. WHY THE FUCK NEW 50GB UPDATE EACH SEASON??</p>
         <br/><h2>VR Chat</h2>
        <p>Native on Linux, good with friends, many configurations that makes it cool.</p>
