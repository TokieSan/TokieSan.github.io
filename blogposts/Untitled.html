    <h1>Untitled</h1> <p>&quot;Finally, I've found some spare time!&quot;, I said, thinking I'll be able to write a blogpost/ play a videogame/ watch a movie. However, &quot;blank&quot; is what I found.</p> <p>Interested in multiple things, I was. Now, I am starting to get into the &quot;comfort zone&quot; loop. Healthy social life, working out, running, eating regularly, studying, etc... Nevertheless, that is not me. I am the rushy guy who never settles on. I'm the hopper that can barely settle on his own body <em>(Maybe Even Switch a hand)</em>.</p> <p>I started this post with the intention to share how my life is tending to the &quot;safe&quot; part, with many improvements, but I instantly found out that safe life is killing me. Sociable and healthy, yeah, but where is the guy who I fell in love with? Where is the man who never planned the hell he is doing the next day? I am no longer interested in myself.</p> <p>&quot;Untitled&quot; can be the only title that suits my current phase. I want my past self, or at least an improved UI/UX of the same base. Changing how I deal with things will eliminate the only perk that caught my attention at first. I <em>need to talk</em> with myself. Maybe have a date to catch up on the lost feelings? Fuck, dates suck, was I about to <strong>plan</strong> a date! [<em>I've failed myself</em>].</p> <p>&quot;The only way to opt-out, is to opt out&quot; (Edward Augustus Bond, 1852). To get out of that endless loop, I need to find my new <em>base case.</em> I'm looking forward to creating some new roads that make my &quot;healthy&quot; life less boring. Risks? Maybe. Illegal shit? Why not. Challenges? CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. I am up to anything right now. My craziness is flooding in a significant growth rate. Let my craziness swallow y'll in the next phase. Be prepared.</p> <p>There is no conclusion to that shit. It's not a fucking academic paper. No more Tokhyness for you today. Go take some risks, bro. Life is short.</p>
