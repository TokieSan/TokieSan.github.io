<h1>My Worst Day Ever (Till Now)</h1> <p><em>Some background info:</em> I live in Egypt, internet speed sucks, and the quota is low that you can barely download one modern game per week. (about 20 megabits per second, quota 140GB). It's the last week in the month, and ofc the 140 gigs are done, and my speed is capped (24 kilobits/sec).</p> <p>My day was average, nothing exciting, until it was about midnight. I was randomly checking short hair chicks on Slide and noticed that images load fast. I checked a speed test to find that the network cap is removed by some type of a glitch! I instantly started the 900 GBs of torrents I had stalled, started updating my outdated games. After about half an hour, I had about 12 gigs downloaded. I canceled my sleeping plans and went to make a coffee and some scrambled eggs. Let the night begin!</p> <p>I am generally not a guy who plans the future. However, this was the only time I started really planning my coming week! I checked what 720p movies I want to be upgraded to 1080p or 4K. I wrote a fast script to automate the process and start scraping torrents of 1337x. The night was marked legendary.</p> <p>And now, boi, it started going downhill.</p> <p>After being served a five-star meal, a premium coffee, and a silver lining, I faced a very unwelcoming event. Electricity went out due to a non-recharged electricity card. My heartbeats went up to 120, internet went off, everything stopped. I told myself <em>&quot;No problem, it's only temporary. I will recharge electricity, and I'll resume the perfect night.&quot;</em> But man, I was too optimistic. After recharging electricity, I waited for the internet to be on to test. It was the most stressful moment in my life, more than my grades, more than college decision time, more than breakups. My blood pressure was too high that the temperature sensor readings went up. And then, the final moment, the internet is on and went to test the internet, and I got a shock that beats the surprise of a person who found out to be adopted, and his current wife is his blood sister <em>[Sweet Home Alabama]</em>. I saw my happiness ceasing, and depression arose. I had plans! For the first time in my life, I had fucking plans for a whole week, and it all got scattered in the air. My life's dreams are ruined.</p> <p>Fuck the shit-mouthed ass-faced dick-cut electric company, and their fucking &quot;turn off&quot; policies; you turned my night off.</p>
