<h1>Hello World: Blog Announcement!</h1><p>Hello Folks! I've now finished the whole blog shit here. I wanted it to look good, minimal, clean, fast, easy to maintain to me. I think I have achieved all that shit. More info below.</p> <hr> <h3>Pre-Project</h3> <p>I was inspired by the guys in <a href="https://512kb.club/">512kb.club</a>, and decided that JS is useless for my website. Also, I didn't want to use any framworks, they are so fucking bloated and almost useless to use. Besides, the whole thing has to be simple for me to maintain. However, I wanted first to see what <strong>not to do</strong>, so I made a 10-min trial on a random blogging website (see it <a href="https://tokiesan.blogspot.com/">here</a>). It was fucking using 128KB! For a fucking simple blog. Then, I decided to make a simpler version that does not exceed (as a base) 10KB, with text (for blogposts) only in addtion. So I did put the damn thing and checked some old web projects I made in middle school. I decided to screw far from the fuckin MB-measured-websites and services for something that can be done in few KBs, and still looks smart.</p> <p>My goals were:</p> <ol> <li>Size &lt;= 10KB for the base.</li> <li>Use no services/ frameworks. Just plain HTML and some CSS.</li> <li>Use Markdown for writing posts and some other things.</li> <li>Static webpages.</li> </ol> <p>What I didn't care about:</p> <ol> <li>Reusability.</li> <li>Practicality, no issue if used some weird stuff to achieve previous goals.</li> </ol> <p>And then, I started the thing.</p> <h2>Mid-Project</h2> <p>It was actually very easy to start, I took an approach for using invert filter instead of specific colors (Crazy approach, I'll change it later). Also, I decided to use github-pages since they make deployment easy.</p> <p>For writing blogs, I decided to go with markdown style. Besides, since I decided not to use any frameworks/ services, I found using simple shell scripts overpowered for my simple purposes. I used md2html utility (it came as a prerequisite for a pkg I had installed lol), and made <a href="../blog.sh">a simple script</a> that uses sys utils, and voila the things worked weirdly good.</p> <blockquote> <p>#The script in short:</br>cat head &gt;&gt; blogposts/${title}</br>md2thml ${1} &gt;&gt; blogposts/${title}</br>#I'm sure you get the idea.</p> </blockquote> <p>For the Atom feed it wasn't hard to implement it in the shell script using awk utility. Then, I tried it and it worked flawlessly. I used the same &quot;shell script&quot; thing for adding elements to track and wishlist with the same shit.</p> <p>I thought of hosting the website myself on some small linux server, but the <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/compare/nlVgH4hC/JlErmHjT">results</a> were in favor of github-pages. So I will go with the latter till I get rich enough.</p> <h2>Post-Project</h2> <p>I achieved all the goals! the website base was only 2KB uncompressed with text as an extra, used only static HTML and CSS with shell scripting backend. <em>[Silently Laughs]</em></p><p>It was fun tbh, my Winter class got cancelled so I took like an hour per day for the past two weeks to do a part of this shit. I am very happy with the project, it fulfilled its simple purpose <em><strong>(spaghetti and proud)</strong></em>.</p> <p>I am not willing to do much changes, may revert that invert shit I did put and I'll be done. I am willing to write more blogposts this year here since I was too lazy to write tbh, maybe get outside of my rock and share the website with couple of friends.</p> <p>And finally, the source code is <a href="https://github.com/TokieSan/TokieSan.github.io/tree/transfer">here</a>, and thanks github-pages for hosting the website, but fuck you Microsoft.</p> <p>Have a nice day folks ^^.</p>
