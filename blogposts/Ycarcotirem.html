<h1>Ycarcotirem</h1> <p>In my country, similar to almost the whole world, some professions get worshiped out of nowhere. I, myself, was once a victim in this cult's bullshit. For instance, in Egypt, the 'Engineering' and 'Medical-related' majors get some worthless attention from people. This is mainly an ancestor of humanity's greed and favoring domination over your fellow humans.</p> <p>But let's cut the humor and discuss the real thing. While meritocracy makes sense, &quot;worthy people get in control&quot;, it's almost non-existent. Being intelligent as fuck myself, I can guarantee that intelligence was not the ingredient of my success.</p> <p>To dominate in this shitty asshole of a world, you must be family or friends with someone else who got power or create power yourself through unorthodox methods. I have mentioned before that I am not a bureaucrat, so I have missed the &quot;easy&quot; way of domination here. Now I need to be &quot;smart&quot;, not in a study-in-college or learn-stuff way, but in a misleading and deceptive one.</p> <p>&quot;BUT TOKHY, THAT IS NOT ETHICAL!&quot;</p> <p>Do you believe yourself? What in this shitty world is ethical? Trump being in charge? Monopolies tracking your data? Billionaires earn trillions, and minimum wage barely gets two eggs? In this world of unethicalties, the only way to pass with the highest yield is to cheat your way through. Let's stress on that.</p> <p>I am not a US citizen. However, I have been a big lurker in /biz/ and money-related subreddits. Specifically, r/wallstreetbets last incidence suit this article. For years, the degenerates in WSB were losing billions and winning millions over evident autism, and that's what makes it beautiful. However, without any financial jargon, the recent incident of billionaires short selling (selling losing stocks to get profit over buyers) $GME stocks. On the other side of these billionaire bitches, our WSB autistics decided to buy the stock and let it go to the moon. Billionaires got crazy. After years of manipulating the market for the sake of earning a profit, some autistics from a social media website make them lose millions.</p> <p>While the story for WSB is not related to the article's context, it allowed many people to sense a slight power of manipulation. People were amazed by such a superpower even though it will not stand for a couple of months. Back to the assholes' hand, you will notice that these assholes were having this power of manipulation for centuries. They were using each inch of the economy in their favor, and you autistics were happy for a dip from the head once. At the same time, the rich quadruple-penetrated your holes for years. Got the seriousness of the issue?</p> <p>While in the real article I finished by describing my intentions deeply, a quick read before publishing made me realize that the previous one included some information that would identify me as a narcissistic sociopath. Also, they will reveal some unnecessary details for you to know right now.</p> <p>So, just think about this article as enlightenment for yourself to get rid of the submissive world of underpaid labor to the throne of bureaucracy.</p>
